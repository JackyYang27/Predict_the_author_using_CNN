# Predict_the_author_using_CNN

Welcome to the **Predict the Author using CNN** project!

This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to identify the author of famous paintings. If you're interested in the detailed methodology and results, please refer to the **PDF document** included in this repository for a comprehensive explanation.

Feel free to explore the code and reach out if you have any questions or suggestions. Iâ€™d love to discuss and improve the project with you!
